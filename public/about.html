<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a creative and results-driven UI/UX Designer with over four years of experience crafting user-focused digital
  solutions for SaaS, e-commerce, and vacation rental platforms. With a strong foundation in user-centered design, I
  specialize in transforming complex requirements into intuitive, visually appealing interfaces that enhance user
  experience and drive engagement. My proficiency in industry-standard tools like Figma and Adobe XD, coupled
  with a solid understanding of design systems and usability principles, enables me to deliver impactful
  solutions that align with both business goals and user needs.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have led the design and optimization of core product modules such as event
  management systems, analytics dashboards, and booking flows. My role at Crescerance India, working
  on Engagifii.com, allowed me to significantly improve user retention by 20% through strategic UX
  refinements and usability testing. Similarly, at Skimbox US, my redesign of a vacation rental
  platform led to a 30% increase in sign-ups and a 20% boost in bookings. These successes
  reflect my ability to blend creative vision with data-driven design decisions in
  fast-paced Agile environments.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I bring strong collaboration and leadership qualities, having managed design
  teams and worked closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders. I am also committed to
  continuous learning, holding certifications from Google and Georgia Tech in UX design. Passionate
  about creating seamless digital experiences, I thrive in challenges that require innovation,
  empathy, and a deep understanding of user behavior.</p>
